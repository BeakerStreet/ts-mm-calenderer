Daniel Rongo,Senior Advisor (AI),EY,"I’m a founder with a passion for growing tech businesses looking for “organized scale” and building teams that thrive on collaboration.

Currently, I’m focused on creating impactful ventures and tech collaborations for large consulting firms (e.g. Ernst & Young), corporations and startups via Industry Gap. 

I also occasionally do revenue and management consulting for fast-growing startups (>$5M ARR), and I tend to focus on helping founder-led sales organizations or the VP of Sales / Growth structure their sales motion.

Prior to that, I built and sold Funden, a tech-enabled fundraising firm, to a Private Equity fund in just two years. Before that, I was the Chief Revenue Officer at Foodics, a Dubai-based unicorn, where I grew the company’s annual revenue from $300k to $7M, driving its valuation from $2M to >$100M.",

Pete Trainor,"Global Ai Strategy & Design Lead
",MSQ,"Hello. I'm Pete and I am an experienced Product, Ai, UX and Design Strategy leader, with vocational expertise in Applied Ai and emerging technologies, based in London. 

I have over 20 years of hands-on experience dedicated to developing and implementing data-driven service design strategies and products that address business challenges, ethical risks and the societal impacts for new technologies. I'm referred to as a thought leader in my field, but I consider myself to be more of team player with a passion for solving complex problems together.

“I’m a total equaliser — Technology is a team sport. We solve it, not me or I. A Victory Royale in Fortnite always tastes better in a squad than a solo.”

I try to combine an acute understanding of human behaviour with technical knowledge to help create innovative solutions that not only enhance user experience but also align with ethical and governance standards. As a business lead I have collaborated with governments, tier-one tech companies, and international organisations to develop robust frameworks, approaches and policies that promote responsible technology integration and use.

An occasional author and influential speaker, I’d like to think some of my insights have significantly shaped contemporary technology, but also policy and practice.

Beyond my focus on Service Design, Innovation and Ai, I am passionate about leveraging technology to improve societal systems and address global challenges. My approach is holistic, integrating design thinking, strategic foresight, and ethical considerations to drive impactful change. I have a single guiding philosophy; ""Don’t do things better, do better things.""

I wrote some books, battled through dyslexia, and want to try and leave the world a little bit better than how I found it.",2025-03-28

The spin out was made possible with a £2m seed investment from Hoxton Ventures (Hussein Kanji was on our board and I'm now an LP in Hoxton), and Speedinvest. We lasted 1yr and 10months before Sophos (a Thoma Bravo backed global cyber company) acquired us for decent 8 figure amount (which is the classic tech tuck in acquisition playbook. We achieved a 466 multiple on revenue....our revenue was small, but it was still a great exit for all involved and I learnt a load). 
Fast forward the clock to today, 2.5yrs post exit, all of my ex-startup team members are still working together at Sophos and we successfully integrated our technology into the Sophos stack and have generated significant revenue as a result.

Corey Cummins,Head of EMEA Partner Acquisitions ,Snowflake,"I'm excited to join Techstars as a mentor, working with early-stage founders to help them build smarter, more efficient revenue engines. A lot of companies focus on sales or marketing in isolation—but real scale comes from looking at the entire revenue cycle, end to end. I love helping teams connect the dots across GTM, systems, and partnerships so they can grow faster, more predictably, and with better margins.

With 15+ years of experience in SaaS, data platforms, and B2B tech, I’ve built and led high-impact go-to-market teams across enterprise sales, partnerships, and ecosystems in both startup and global environments.

At Snowflake, I lead the EMEA partner GTM strategy—driving co-sell, joint solutions, and new logo acquisition with 50+ SI, ISV, and Cloud partners. I've built and scaled partner teams across UK&I, Benelux, and Nordics, delivering $45M+ in revenue and launching frameworks that drive partner-seller collaboration and value-based selling.

Previously, I co-founded REalyse, a real estate data platform where I grew ARR from 0 to £800K+, closed 48 enterprise customers, and raised £4M+ in venture funding. I led GTM, built key partnerships with government and data providers, and scaled our sales org from scratch.

I’ve lived and worked in the UK, Singapore & Australia partnering with some of the world’s most innovative business leaders.

Whilst primarily working in Talent Acquisition I’ve always led on broader HR and Workforce change and transformations such as strategic workforce planning, operating model transformations, de/re-centralisation of various functions and tech implementations such as Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, Beamery & more.
