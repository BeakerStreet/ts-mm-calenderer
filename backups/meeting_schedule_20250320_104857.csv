I have over 20 years of hands-on experience dedicated to developing and implementing data-driven service design strategies and products that address business challenges, ethical risks and the societal impacts for new technologies.

“I’m a total equaliser — Technology is a team sport. We solve it, not me or I. A Victory Royale in Fortnite always tastes better in a squad than a solo.”

I try to combine an acute understanding of human behaviour with technical knowledge to help create innovative solutions that not only enhance user experience but also align with ethical and governance standards.

An occasional author and influential speaker, I’d like to think some of my insights have significantly shaped contemporary technology, but also policy and practice.

Beyond my focus on Service Design, Innovation and Ai, I am passionate about leveraging technology to improve societal systems and address global challenges.

I have over 20 years of hands-on experience dedicated to developing and implementing data-driven service design strategies and products that address business challenges, ethical risks and the societal impacts for new technologies. I'm referred to as a thought leader in my field, but I consider myself to be more of team player with a passion for solving complex problems together.

I try to combine an acute understanding of human behaviour with technical knowledge to help create innovative solutions that not only enhance user experience but also align with ethical and governance standards. As a business lead I have collaborated with governments, tier-one tech companies, and international organisations to develop robust frameworks, approaches and policies that promote responsible technology integration and use.

At Lindus Health, I tripled revenue by expanding the addressable market and implementing structured processes. At Stripe, I led the EMEA expansion for Card Issuing, co-founding the region’s first dedicated product team and driving 19x revenue growth. Before that, I built and exited three startups.

Outside of work, I love adventure — whether it's backpacking across Asia with my wife and 8-month-old or running marathons post-cancer treatment years ago. I am also passionate about supporting founders, volunteering as mentor and angel investor with various accelerator programs.

Pete Trainor <> Parasol,2025-03-28T13:15:00,2025-03-28T13:35:00,Parasol,Pete Trainor,"Pete Trainor, Global Ai Strategy & Design Lead
, MSQ: Hello. I'm Pete and I am an experienced Product, Ai, UX and Design Strategy leader, with vocational expertise in Applied Ai and emerging technologies, based in London. 

I have over 20 years of hands-on experience dedicated to developing and implementing data-driven service design strategies and products that address business challenges, ethical risks and the societal impacts for new technologies. I'm referred to as a thought leader in my field, but I consider myself to be more of team player with a passion for solving complex problems together.

“I’m a total equaliser — Technology is a team sport. We solve it, not me or I. A Victory Royale in Fortnite always tastes better in a squad than a solo.”

I try to combine an acute understanding of human behaviour with technical knowledge to help create innovative solutions that not only enhance user experience but also align with ethical and governance standards. As a business lead I have collaborated with governments, tier-one tech companies, and international organisations to develop robust frameworks, approaches and policies that promote responsible technology integration and use.

An occasional author and influential speaker, I’d like to think some of my insights have significantly shaped contemporary technology, but also policy and practice.

Beyond my focus on Service Design, Innovation and Ai, I am passionate about leveraging technology to improve societal systems and address global challenges. My approach is holistic, integrating design thinking, strategic foresight, and ethical considerations to drive impactful change. I have a single guiding philosophy; ""Don’t do things better, do better things.""

I wrote some books, battled through dyslexia, and want to try and leave the world a little bit better than how I found it.","Kasparharsaae@parasolplatforms.com, momirzan@parasolplatforms.com",https://techstars-ldn-mentor-lookbook.lovable.app/mentor/pete-trainor,2025-03-28

On top of that I have led the development of, and now run, our main product (Cimple) which last year turned profitable and will deliver £1m+ turnover. 

From this the technical experience I can help founders with is anything related to the day-to-day running of their business whether it be focussed on enterprise sales or SaaS. A particular area of strength is helping founders to build leading teams and do more with less financially. My market expertise is anything related to Supply Chains and working with Governments.

However, the most important experiences that I can bring are all of the harder sides of running a company. I have dealt with legal issues, financial distress, international disputes, employee wellbeing issues, redundancies, personal impacts and many more.
